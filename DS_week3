Row based querying:
-iloc and loc attributes

Column based querying:
-using brackets on the object itself

Boolean masking:
-powerful filtering method which allows us to use broadcasting to determine what data should be kept in our analysis


Merging data frames:
Full outer join (union)
Inner join (intersection)
Left join 
Right join

-> .merge 

Pandas idioms (pandorables)

Chain indexing ][:
-i.e. df.loc['Washtenaw']['Total Population']
- generally bad practice
- could be returning a copy or a view

Method chaining:
- returns a reference
- can condense many different operations into one line of code

.apply

Group by:
-This function takes some column name or names and splits the dataframe up into chunks based on those names, it returns a dataframe group by object which can be iterated upon
- returns a tuple where the first item is the group condition,
and the second item is the data frame reduced by that grouping. 

- split apply combine pattern

.agg method:
- applies a function to the column or columns of data in the group and returns the result

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- series groupby and dataframe groupby behave differently with aggregate
Scales:
1. Ratio:
- units are equally spaced
- operations like +-/* are all valid
2. Interval:
- units are equally spaced, but there is no true zero
3. Ordinal:
- order of the units is important, but not evenly spaced
4. Nominal:
- categories of data, but the categories have no order with respect to one another

.astype
.cut

Pivot tables:
- a data frame, where the rows represent one variable that
you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value.

.pivot_table

Date funcionality:
Timestamp
Period
Period Index
DateTime Index
Timedelta

.date_range
.diff
.resample
.asfreq
